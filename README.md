# constructorHangman

Had a rough week with work, so this assignment didn't reach completion.

I have a prompt to capture a letter.

I have a letter function that can validate against a set secret word, if I pass in a variable as an argument at the node command.

I got started on the word constructor. I had the wrong logic. I was capturing correct guesses into the word's array rather than using it to build the letters in the secret words getting handed in from the index file.

The chaining together of arguments to pass through from index through word to letter isn't making sense to me yet. I did some googling of other examples to try to jumpstart my awareness, but it is far from making sense to me.

Here's hoping that more exposure will help soon.
